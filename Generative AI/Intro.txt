> Generative AI - It is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio, and synthetic data. 

> AI --> ML --> DL

> AI is a discipline, like physics for example. AI is a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of intelligence agents, which are systems that 
  can reason, and learn, and act autonomously.   

> AI - is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence.

> In this discipline we have Machine Learning (ML), which is a subfield of AI. It is a program or system that trains a model from input data. That trained 
  model can make useful predictions from new or never before seen data, drawn from the same one used to train the model.

> ML - gives computers the ability to learn without explicit programming

> Two of the most common classes of ML models;
  . Unsupervised ML models - we have labels. Labeled data is data that comes with a tag like a name, a type or a number.
  . Supervised ML models - data that comes with no tag

> Deep Learning (DL) - uses artificial neural networks - allowing them to process more complex patterns than traditional machine learning.

> Generative AI - It is a subset of Deep Learning, which means it uses artificial neural networks, can process both labeled and unlabeled data using
  Supervised, Unsupervised, and semi-Supervised methods.

> LLMs - LArge LAnguage Models are also a subset of DL

> What is Generative AI?
  . GenAI is a type of AI that creates new content based on what it has learned from existing content   
  . The process of learning from existing content is called training and results in the creation of a statistical model. 
  . When given a prompt , GenAI uses this statistical model to predict what an expected response might be - and this generates new content
